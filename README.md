**Develop simulation models to get accurate results and enhance decision-making processes**

## What is this book about?
Simulation modeling helps you to create digital prototypes of physical models to analyze how they work and predict their performance in the real world. With this comprehensive guide, you'll understand various computational statistical simulations using Python.

This book covers the following exciting features: <First 5 What you'll learn points>
* Gain an overview of the different types of simulation models
* Get to grips with the concepts of randomness and data generation process
* Understand how to work with discrete and continuous distributions
* Work with Monte Carlo simulations to calculate a definite integral
* Find out how to simulate random walks using Markov chains
